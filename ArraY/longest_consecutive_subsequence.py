the consecutive numbers can be in any order.
'''
## function work...!!!!
'''
findLCS() function--> which takes the array arr[]
and the size of the array as inputs and
returns the length of the longest subsequence of consecutive integers.
'''
## Here we use the hashmap to store element..
def findlcs(arr,n):
    pass

## Driver code...!!!!
if __name__ == "__main__":
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int,input().split()))
