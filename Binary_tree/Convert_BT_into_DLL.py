# Python program to convert binary tree to doubly linked list
## this set-1 approach to convert BT_to_DLL hence their exist 2 more approach..
"""
The problem here is simpler as we donâ€™t need to create a circular DLL, but a simple DLL. The idea behind its solution is quite simple and straight.

    1. If the left subtree exists, process the left subtree
        1. Recursively convert the left subtree to DLL.
        2. Then find the inorder predecessor of the root in the left subtree (the inorder predecessor is the rightmost node in the left subtree).
        3. Make the inorder predecessor as the previous root and the root as the next in order predecessor.
     2.If the right subtree exists, process the right subtree (Below 3 steps are similar to the left subtree).
        1.Recursively convert the right subtree to DLL.
        2.Then find the inorder successor of the root in the right subtree (in order the successor is the leftmost node in the right subtree).
        3.Make the inorder successor as the next root and the root as the previous inorder successor.
    3.Find the leftmost node and return it (the leftmost node is always the head of a converted DLL).
